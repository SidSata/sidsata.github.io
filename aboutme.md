Hey! My name is Siddhant Satapathy, and I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in History.

This is my second semester teaching Data 100, I'm looking forward to a fantastic semester and am super excited to meet you!

Some things I do:

- Cook (and occasionally set off fire alarms)
- Read (and hoard books)
- Hike!
- Play soccer
- Pontificate about crypto
- Sport perhaps the strangest accent ever (I don't know how either)

Feel free to reach out to me at satapathy (at) berkeley.edu! Happy to talk about anything at all :-))
